I'm Phitrapy, currently working as a front-end developper in Nantes, at [RCA](https://rca.fr/).

I love how IT has so many interesting fields to explore... This is why I keep fiddling with it!

I am mostly working with Angular at the moment though I've also used other front-end frameworks, such as React, Vue, but also other platforms like Android!

When needed, I put my back-end knowledge to good use, though I'd rather delegate it to Firebase than work it all through Spring Boot.
