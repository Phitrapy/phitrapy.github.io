I'm just starting this blog, though I already see a few features I'd like to have here... Hopefully I will be able to implement them!

I want to share them here, though I might convert them to gitlab issues!

__Here is the list:__
* Internationalization 🇫🇷 / 🇬🇧
* A custom theme! 🎨
* A comment section 💬 (with [staticman](https://staticman.net/)? Usefull [info here](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/static-comments-improved/))
* Pictures for my blog posts
* Thumbnails to display the pictures for my post list
* A "last modified" feature for blog posts
